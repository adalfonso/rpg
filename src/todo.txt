fix: align battle menu to player
feat: saving commits but doesnt force save. if we change how the state for
      something is calculated during deve it wont forcefully write the new data
      e.g. rename a field in the state, defeated -> killed, and both will persist
fix: item collider and sprites are not the same
fix: weapons render smaller in inventory than overworld

redo battle menu
